## Prefix Issue
When inviting the bot to your server, it should automatically use `b!` as prefix. However this doesn't always work. So if you added the bot, try `b!help` and if it does not respond, follow these steps:
- Join the support server (https://discord.gg/k8ZZb2X9D7)
- Open a ticket in `„Äåüì•„Äçopen-a-ticket`
- Send the ID of the server you added the bot to into the ticket
- Staff will give your server the standard prefix `b!`
- You can change the server's prefix with `b!changeprefix <new_prefix>`

## Offline
When the bot is offline all the prefixes of the bot will be reset once the bot is onlie again, so everytime the bot reboots, you'll need to change it again. If both prefixes `b!` and your custom prefix don't work, follow the steps from above again.
