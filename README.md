## Prefix Issue
When inviting the bot to your server, it should automatically use `b!` as prefix. However this doesn't always work. So if you added the bot, try `b!help` and if it does not respond, follow these steps:
- Join the support server (https://discord.gg/k8ZZb2X9D7)
- Open a ticket in `„Äåüì•„Äçopen-a-ticket`
- Send the ID of the server you added the bot to into the ticket
- Staff will give your server the standard prefix `b!`
- You can change the server's prefix with `b!changeprefix <new_prefix>`

## Offline / Reboot
When the bot is offline or rebootinng all the prefixes of the bot will be reset to the standard `b!` once the bot is online again, so everytime the bot reboots, you'll need to change it again. If both prefixes `b!` and your custom prefix don't work, follow the steps from above again.
